## About

Welcome to my C Development Folder! Here, I can:

- Practice coding in C.
- Create and test new C programs.
- Store and organize my C projects.

I plan to use this repository as a learning resource, a code repository, or both. I might also collaborate with others to work on C projects together.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before I start using this repository, I need the following prerequisites:

- A C/C++ development environment (e.g., GCC or Visual Studio Code with C/C++ extension).
- Git (optional but recommended for version control).

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to my local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/my-username/c-development-folder.git
Create a new directory for my C projects or navigate to an existing one:

bash
Copy code
cd c-development-folder
Start writing my C code, create new C files, and organize my projects.

Compile and run my C programs using my preferred development environment or compiler.

I can also collaborate with others by sharing this repository or inviting them as collaborators.

Happy coding!
